# R Programming Project - Covid-19 Deaths
## Introduction

Hello and welcome to my first R Programming project. This won't be a deep dive like my Google Data Analytics Case Study, but rather a quick showcase of my Data Analytics skills focusing on R.  



## Data Sources

The Dataset used in this project was retrieved from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset) by user SRK. It uses data just from 2019.



## Changelog & Cleaning

As a departure from my other repositories, I will not be explaining the step-by-step process here, as I have put each step and thought process in the comments of the R Markdown. 
You can find the R Programming code here: [R Programming Code](https://github.com/stgordillo/r_programming_project/blob/main/r_programming_code.rmd)


## Visualization Steps
This section is being reserved, as I do plan to expand on this project at a later date and create visualizations for what I found in order to continue my practice with R Programming.
